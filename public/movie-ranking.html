<h1>The Best Movies According to Livia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies so far!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bridesmaid</h3>
<p>It's my first british friend's favorite, and I discover it by accident, and I love it. <br />
   I've rewatched this movie for several times already! <br />
   It's about friendship, precious.

<h3>The Judge</h3>
<p>My previous dream job is a lawer, I want to be one of them which help people get out of tough situation.</p>

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>I love the scenary in this movie, and I also love how simple the vibe in this movie</p>

<h3>Up In the air</h3>
<p>Oops, the list got longer than I expected :) <br />
   The reason I love this movie it's because I used to travel a lot for work in my younger days, not anymore for now, but I can relate somewhat the main character's conseption of getting out of the unwanted life.
